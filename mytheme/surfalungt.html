        <h1>Surfalugnt.se Ethics and moral</h1>
        <p>First of all I got very releived when I heard abot this website, that it exist a site like this.</p>
        <p>Young people on the internet is a new phenonema that´s growing rapidly.</p>
        <p>The fact that this website exist is a good help for alot of people, manly adults, who would like information on what is actually going on in the internet and what can we do to keep it from not causing harm.</p>
        
        <p>I can see that the website Surfalugnt.se is built on ethical facts and its great that they specify a column called ”Fakta och material.”</p>
        <p>I would say the website on its on makes a statement that they provide facts and information but also links to the source, so that you can be critical and judge the material based on your own believes and values.</p>
        <p>This website I would say that serves as a support and does so very well filled with facts, information and advice.</p>
        <p>It is also great to see big companys such as Telenor involved and supporting by doing #Nätprat to help parents discuss about the internet with their children.</p>
        <p> I think a lot of parents and adults can find this topic and information useful and to get more insight in what to talk abot and what to be aware abot regarding internet.</p>
        <p>Also great that they have a crew on experts on the site that you actually can ask questions. This must be very valuable for a lot of concerned adults to get help and advice on the matter.</p>
        <p>They also made a kind of FAQ where you can search for ”regular questions” that may help to get an answer fast.</p>
        
        <p>It´s interesting to reflect on this matter and that this is a whole new topic that brings a lot of questions. It has escalated very fast and websites like this is very important.</p>
        <p>This website is filled with information, facts and advice that clearly serve as a purpose to try and make the internet experience both ethical and moral.</p>
        <p> Internet now plays a huge part in actually shaping our future adults and with websites like this we may have a slightly better chance to catch and react in time.</p>
        
        <p>It is great that they wan´t to inspire adults to be a part of the young ones everyday internetlife.
        That this website has exist since 2005 also tells us that they have bin around since when it all took of with Facebook and so on. </p>
        <p>It´s a well built site and so is the content and they want to make the most of everything that is positive with internet for ypung people.</p>
        <p>Very impressive that they also provide help in 12 different languages.</p>
        <p>I would say Surfalugnt.se is a neutral and informative site based on ethics, however, each individual visitor on this site are going to interpret the material based on their own values and moral compass.</p>
