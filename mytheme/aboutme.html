            <p>My name is Dalton Ramiro im 33 years old and I came from Brazil. I been living in Östersund since 2011, with my wife and 2 children.</p>
            
            <p>I left Brazil back in 2008. At first I moved to Australia so i could learn English, also because I had a passion for the place.</p>
            
            <p>Who wouldn't? Sydney is a beautiful place full of atractions, wonderful beachs and a place with a multi cultural background.</p>      
                        
            <p>For the last 11 years i been working within the Fitness Industries.</p>
            <p>I started back in 2005 when i got my first job as Life Saver, at that time i had started my Phisical Education Degree.</p>
            
            <p>But all started to change in 2006 when i was offered a position as a Gym instructor in a local but small gym.</p>
            <p>I really enjoyed that type of work and I had the chance to put in practice all that I was learning in the University.</p>
            
            <p>But I felt that something was not complete. Inside me I had another desire, even having passion for what I was doing I also had passion for something else.</p>
            <p>I'm being a computer user since I was 12 years old, always had the passion and interest how it worked, from hardware to software.</p>        
            <p>so I tried to become a computer engineer around 2003 but I failed on that attempt due my lack of commitment and responsibility.</p>        
            <p>even that i failed back in time, the desire never left me. Around September of 2017 that desire started to grow again and I decide to get back on the trail.</p>        
            <p> Now being and Adult was easier to find focus and motivation to try even harder, and this time i took my chance. I saw my opportunity in Hermods.</p>  
                
            <p>Now that im older I can dedicate my time wisely and effectively to help myself in achieve something greater. For my family future and for my own happiness.</p>
            <p>I think this is my mission and every step i take ,I see clear where I have to walk to achieve my goals.</p> 
            <p>Most of my spare time on weekends I spend with my family.</p>
            <p>I also spend a great deal of my time using my computer for entertainment and learning.</p>
