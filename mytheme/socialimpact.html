        <p>The internet has allowed the interchange of ideas and materials among scientists, university professors, and students, in addition to provide servers, resource centers and online tools for their research and scholar activities. Moreover, million of books, journals and other material are available through the internet because of the digitization of public domains material from libraries in the States and Europe.</p>

        <h5>Sometimes, the internet can have negative effects, including:</h5>
        
        <p>Illegal or inappropriate materials can be found in the internet.</p>
        <p>Some people in recent years have illegally downloaded music or other copyrighted material for free.</p>

        <p>The addiction to online social networks can disturb a person's way of living and professional activity.</p>
        <p>Some criminals use the internet for spreading computer viruses or even intercepting credit card or bank details for spurious purposes.</p>
            
        
        <h5>we can say that humankind is now almost entirely connected</h5>
        <p>The Internet is the decisive technology of the Information Age, and with the explosion of wireless communication in the early twenty-first century,</p>
        <p>Today, social networking sites are the preferred platforms for all kinds of activities, both business and personal, and sociability has dramatically increased</p>
        <p>The virtual life is becoming more social than the physical life, but it is less a virtual reality than a real virtuality, facilitating real-life work and urban living.</p>
        <p>Networked social movements have been particularly active since 2010, notably in the Arab revolutions against dictatorships and the protests against the management of the financial crisis.</p>
