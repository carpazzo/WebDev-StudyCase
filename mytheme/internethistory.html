        <h1>History of The Internet</h1>

        <p>The internet its the connection between the whole world. It works like a net or a spider web.</p>
        <p>It began with networks that were designed as a way of remotely share program files and access other computers.</p>
        <p>Lately evolved to a  distributed communication system, divided in blocks that has a fast connection between them. </p>
        
        <p>Around the 60's  the internet was an idea of a military connective system that could withstand over a nuclear blast ,</p>
        <p>that reason they decide to out spread the points of connectivity between the appliances in such a way that formed as we know as a WEB or NET. </p>
        <img src="httpimg.jpeg" alt="www" class="samplefr">
        <p>Instead of having all system in one unique point, the information between theses points had to be passed fast and unchangeable.</p>
        
        <p>The internet is owned by the service providers, they are who you pay to make sure that the information you send is going to the right direction, end to end.</p>
        <p>The way it works behind your screen is rather complex but to simplify its like you make an order on a restaurant.</p>


        
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Call the waiter.</li>
                <li>Choose what you want.</li>
                <li>Place your order.</li>
                <li>Dish is made by the chef.</li>
                <li>The waiter bring it back to you.</li>
                <li>Pay the bill.</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>The Internet works basicaly the same way!</h5>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Choose what you want.</li>
                <li>Click in a link to make a request.</li>
                <li>Your request is send to a host or server.</li>
                <li>That will processed. </li>
                <li>Redirect you to the link requested.</li>
                <li>Pay the bill once a month for the service provided.</li>
            </ol>

        

        <p>Note in that simple formula you would be able to connect in to a single source, but as we know they evolved and adapt</p>
        <p>now you are able to connect in many sources of information at same time due a system that they called package system </p>
        <p>where many sources send small packages of information that is build up on the go.</p>

        <p>This system have a standard formatting protocol to make sure all computer connected is speaking the same language </p>
        <p>this system is well know as TCP/IP.</p>
        <h5>TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol.</h5>
        
        <p>At the start they had a unique place to store all data between computer and it was located at Stanford in USA </p>
        <p>but with the growth of the internet and it spread around the country other hosts started to join in to hold up that data</p>
        <p>that couldn't be store in Stanford any longer , due the amount of space required.</p>

        <p>So they decide to create a new system that is called DNS or Domain Name System</p>
        <p>this system is what manage every host and their information in to different departments</p>
        <p> it was like a library of addresses and DNS was a way to catalogue everything and send the correct address upon requested</p>
        <p>in this way they could keep track of all domains and its layers.</p>

        <p>Was only about 1991 when the internet was accessible by the general public</p>
        <p>until this point was first a military communication system as I mentioned and extended to university level starting being a communication between Stanford and UCLA </p>
        <p>lately other university started to join and a better system had to be implemented.</p>

        
        <p>The military product evolved to a more broad audience at this point the military decided to move on to other projects</p>
        <p>since that was accomplished and other company (NSFNET) took over the project making the internet accessible to the public at a price.</p>
