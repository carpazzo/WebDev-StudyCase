        <p>Frontend its most associated with how the website will look and will be displayed to the user, basically the beauty
            display, buttons,menus, images ,animations in some cases dealing with user input and final appearance.</p>
        <p>Behind the scene we have all coding and algorithms to make those animations work properly, the forms linked to the
            proper database, the connection between pages and the safety to access the page rather need a account and password
            (membership) all this part that deal with all administrative and functionally of a website/server is the backend
            .</p>
